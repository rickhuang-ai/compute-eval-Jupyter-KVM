     WARNING
===================

Evaluation of correctness or performance will execute untrusted model-generated
code.

Although it is highly unlikely that model-generated code will do something
overtly malicious in response to this test suite, model-generated code may act
destructively due to a lack of model capability or alignment.

Users are strongly encouraged to sandbox this evaluation suite so that it does
not perform destructive actions on their host or network.

In order to execute this code you must explicitly pass the --allow-execution flag.
